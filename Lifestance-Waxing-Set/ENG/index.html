                    <h3>Why is the wax too stringy?</h3>
                    <p class="answer" id="faq1" style="display: block;">Heating your wax at the wrong temperature
                        can lead to your wax being too stringy. Typically, that's because wax temperature is too cold to
                        stir it. We recommend reheat the wax on professional wax warmer until the wax has reached a
                        honey-like consistency.

                    <h3>How long does the wax take to melt?</h3>
                    <p class="answer" id="faq2">It depends on the quantity of wax you use. Normally, it'll take 10
                        mins if you melt wax of 3.5oz. But if you melt whole bag of lifestance pink hard wax,it will
                        take 20-25 mins for fully melting. When using Lifestance Wax Warmer we recommend using the
                        highest temperature setting. Once the wax has reached a full liquid form you must lower the
                        temperature on your warmer to a low mid-level setting and allow for the wax cool off. Please
                        test the wax temperature and use until the wax has reached a honey-like consistency.

                    <h3>Can I mix the wax?</h3>
                    <p class="answer" id="faq3">Mixing the wax beans is doable but not recommend. As different wax
                        beans have different fomulas. Some targets for coarse hair while some targets for finer hair,
                        some have strong grip, some have low melting point. Mixing multiple variations of the wax can
                        lead to the product not performing the same.But if left only little of wax,it's okay to mix the
                        wax.

                    <h3>How do I remove the wax from my wax warmer?</h3>
                    <p class="answer" id="faq4">Cleaning your wax warmer regularly is important to prevent bacterial
                        growth. Heat your warmer to a high temperature to melt any remaining wax to a liquid
                        consistency. Turn off the unit, then carefully pour out the wax into a container for reuse. Wipe
                        away remaining wax residue with a paper towel or wax strips and mineral oil. The oil will
                        dissolve the wax. You may need to use spatulas to scrape off stubborn wax. There are also
                        cleaners designed specifically for wax warmers.
